Python Practice and Notes (2026)

This repository documents my Python learning through practice,
notes, and reflection.

The goal is to build durable understanding, keep track of what I learn,
and make progress visible over time.

This is a learning-focused repository, not a production project.

Current topics:
- Python strings
