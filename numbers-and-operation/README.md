Python Numbers — Exercises

This folder contains a set of Python numeric exercises designed to practice
real-world number manipulation using built-in numeric operations and functions.

The focus is on writing clean, reusable utility functions that reflect
how numbers are handled in everyday developer work.

==============================

Rules

- One function per exercise
- Function name must clearly describe what it does
- No loops
- No conditionals (if / else)
- No exception handling
- No input/output logic
- Use only numeric operations and built-in numeric functions
- Return values, do not print

Notes

- Exercises are designed to match concepts introduced so far in the
  FreeCodeCamp Python Certification.
- More advanced constructs (conditionals, loops, error handling)
  will be introduced in later modules.
- This folder is intended as a referenceable learning log,
  not a standalone tutorial.
